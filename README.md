## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

- First exercise of form validation and management through JavaScript
- This exercise was meant to validate the JavaScript module during my course at the CEFii school
- At that time, it was only meant to stand in 1 JS file; I chose to preserve that aspect despite the file length
- I reworked it a few times in order to improve the code readability
- I also reworked the various regular expressions for fields validation
